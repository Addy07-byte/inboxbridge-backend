‚úÖ **Yes, you absolutely should write a `README.md` now** ‚Äî even at this early stage.

Here‚Äôs **why** it‚Äôs worth doing *right now* (even if it's not ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù):

## üß† Why Write a README Now?

| Reason                   | Why It Matters                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ First impression       | Anyone visiting your repo (recruiters, teammates, BRM) knows what it's about immediately |
| ‚úÖ Milestone marker       | It documents what works **right now** ‚Äî great for tracking progress                      |
| ‚úÖ Shows professionalism  | Even a short README signals you're serious about your work                               |
| ‚úÖ Easier to update later | Start simple, improve as you add PostgreSQL, AI, etc.                                    |

## ‚úçÔ∏è What to Include in This Stage

Since your project just handles `POST /messages` and uses in-memory storage, your README can include:

### ‚úÖ Basic Sections

````md
# InboxBridge Backend

A TypeScript + Node.js backend API that accepts user messages and prepares them for classification and storage ‚Äî inspired by tools like BRM‚Äôs assistant system.

## Features

- `POST /messages` ‚Äì Accepts sender, subject, body, and category
- Basic input validation
- In-memory message storage (PostgreSQL integration coming next)
- Fully tested with `curl` and REST clients

## Tech Stack

- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Express.js

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
````

4. Test the endpoint:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/messages \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"sender": "user@example.com", "subject": "Test", "body": "Hello world", "category": "legal"}'
   ```

## Future Roadmap

* [ ] Store messages in PostgreSQL
* [ ] Add `GET /messages` route
* [ ] Integrate OpenAI for auto-categorization
* [ ] Add simple frontend or Postman collection

Would you like me to generate this as a `README.md` file and give you the copy-paste version?
